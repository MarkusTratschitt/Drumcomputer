# Drumcomputer

Nuxt 4 drum machine using Vue 3 Options API + TypeScript strict, Vuetify 3 (Pug + Less), Web Audio lookahead scheduling, Web MIDI capability checks, and IndexedDB stubs for soundbanks.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# QA
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

## Features

- Lookahead Web Audio scheduler with AudioContext time, quantized live recording, and 16-pad grid sequencing.
- Default kit served from `public/samples` and auto-loaded into the audio engine; patterns persist via LocalStorage (v1 schema with normalization).
- Pinia stores for transport, patterns/scenes, session caps, and soundbanks; composables for audio, scheduler, sequencer, MIDI, sync, import/export, audio input, and IndexedDB soundbank storage (banks, samples, patterns).
- Client-only MIDI hooks with device selection, pad mapping, and MIDI clock support (master/slave) plus Ableton Link stub exposure via sync panel.
- Soundbank manager can select banks and replace pad samples (stored as blobs in IndexedDB) with lazy decoding; patterns also persisted per-bank in IDB.
- Configurable step grid divisions (1/2/4/8/16/32/64) with responsive layout for larger sequences and stable transport start/stop handling.
- Import/Export helpers for patterns, MIDI (@tonejs/midi), soundbank manifests + sample blobs, and WAV bounce via OfflineAudioContext.

## Browser support / limitations

- Web MIDI only over HTTPS/localhost after user permission; device lists stay empty when unsupported.
- Audio input uses `getUserMedia`; user denial disables monitoring/capture.
- AudioContext needs a user gesture before it can play in some browsers; first pad tap will resume the context.
- Background throttling can delay scheduled steps despite lookahead; keep tab focused for tight timing.

## Roadmap

- FX chain (filter/drive), pattern scenes, and extended sample browser with drag/drop.
