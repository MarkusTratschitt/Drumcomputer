| PLUGIN | Plug-in | Cutoff, Resonance, Attack, Release, Drive, Mix, Stereo, Output | Instance/Swap, Preset, Bypass, Enable, Param, Macro, Browse, Remove | Plug-in chain / Instance meta |
| ARRANGER | Scenes | Scene Bars, Repeat, Section, Swing, Vel Mod, Humanize, Shift, Accent | Scenes, Sections, Duplicate, Length, Follow, Loop, Grid, Clear | Scenes list / Layout overview |
| MIXER | Mix | Kick, Snare, Hat, Perc, Bus Comp, Saturate, Send A, Send B | Levels, Pan, Sends, FX, Group, Master, Cue, Meters | Channel strip / Sends & FX |
| BROWSER | Library, Recent | Filter, Cutoff, Res, Rate, Depth, Space, Tone, Volume (Recent: Preview controls) | Search/Plug-in Menu, Type, Tag, Favorites, Prehear/Stop, Load, Replace, Clear | Categories with search / Results & preview |
| SAMPLING | Sampling | Start, End, Snap, Silence, Attack, Hold, Release, Gain | Record, Edit, Slice, Detect, Normalize, Fade, Apply, Discard | Waveform info / Sampling actions |

- Page ◀/▶ cycles pages per mode (clamped). SHIFT + mode triggers secondary action (e.g., CHANNEL→MIDI, PLUGIN→Instance, BROWSER→Plug-in menu, FILE→Save As, MACRO→Set).
- Encoders support mouse wheel on hover and ArrowUp/Down/Left/Right keys; SHIFT performs fine steps.
